While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a &lsquo;what-is-needed&rsquo; basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn&rsquo;t have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was located in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.</p><p>In order to work on a ticket, the person who wanted to work on it claimed it, created a branch off of develop based on our naming conventions and, whenever they thought it was done, created a merge request.
In the beginning of our development, we often ran into problems with actually getting the merge requests reviewed and approved. To counteract that, we agreed upon a process, where we&rsquo;d notify the rest of the team in our chat, as emails sent by Gitlab were often ignored.</p></div></section><section><h3>Code-review is important!</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>All new code had to be reviewed before being merged into the develop branch. We never merged our code before a given merge request was approved by a a person who had not developed the feature. When merge requests became too large, the person who implemented it would sit down with a reviewer and walk them through it, adapting the code where it was needed.</div></section><section><h3>Corona and Remote Work</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Due to Corona, our semester and team work were also conducted fully remotely. We had weekly team meetings and often substituted those by having multiple calls during the week / Sprint. While some of the decisions might have been taken more quickly in an onsite setting, we found that pair-programming remotely worked well with the tools we had chosen.</div></section><section><h3>Difficulties we encountered</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Our team had very varying skill-sets, which in some cases led to one or two members feeling stranded and left alone. This could&rsquo;ve have been more easily avoided in a normal project setting, but due to the remote context, we didn&rsquo;t always notice it right away.</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/preview/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
