Installing the plugins does not mean they will be used for every test. Teachers can turn the feature on and off for each test they create. If this feature is activated, students will be asked to rate the difficulty of questions. Once a question in a test has been rated by the student, it won’t be eligible for review anymore. The review will be displayed at the end of the question and consists of a heatbar with review options from easy to very difficult. All feedback is collected anonymously to ensure honest and unbiased responses. The student review should not be performed for all questions, but only for a proportion of them, in order to keep the load as low as possible. For each question, a random number between 0 and 1 is generated at the beginning of the test attempt. The questions for which the numbers are between 0 and 0.5 are then selected for a student review. From this, it can be deduced that students may not have to evaluate any tasks in a test. It is also possible that all tasks can be evaluated.</div></section><section><h3>Student Review Deferred</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>There are two versions of the assessment function: deferred and immediate. This allows for flexible use of the function, depending on didactic requirements. In the deferred version, submitting a difficulty assessment is optional. This is because students do not receive feedback on the content of their assignment until they have answered all the questions in the test. This means that students cannot be &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to submit a rating. However, it is also possible to rate the level of difficulty even if the question has not been answered. This is because if the question is not answered, students may still perceive it as very difficult and provide relevant feedback.</div></section><section><h3>Student Review Immediate</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>With the &lsquo;Immediate&rsquo; variant, students receive immediate feedback on the content of their question when they click the &lsquo;Check&rsquo; button. After that, the entry cannot be changed. With the Student Review Immediate plugin, the difficulty of the question is queried afterwards, as with the deferred variant. The difference from the deferred version is that students must submit a rating to receive feedback on their answer to the quiz question. This is intended to encourage students to evaluate the questions in order to receive content-related feedback.</div></section><section><h3>Student Report</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Teachers can view and export data for further use in the quiz reports. For each question in a test, key metrics such as the average and median of the given ratings are calculated and presented in a report. The calculations are based exclusively on the anonymised student reviews and make it possible to identify questions that students consider particularly easy or difficult. In addition to these metrics, information such as the internal question name, the question text, general feedback and the associated question ID is also displayed in the report. An export function is provided for further analysis or archiving. The data can be exported to CSV, PDF, HTML table, JSON, Excel and ODS format.</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/preview/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
